## Broken Syntax Highlighting

* Quit Xcode
* Finder > Go (hold down the Option key while Go is selected – this will cause Library to pop up)
* Select Library
* Navigate to Developer/Xcode/Derived Data
* Find the folder that has your app name and a jumble of characters behind it, i.e. “MyApp-dfwdfdfakjakjaka”
* Delete the folder.
* Launch Xcode and open your project
* It will be re-indexed and you’ll see a folder pop back into your Derived Data folder for the project.
